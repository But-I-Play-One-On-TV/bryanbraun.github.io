I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The weather is getting warmer every day.

## At Work

I'm working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/). Most of my time coding is spent writing Javascript. I've worked a lot in React and Angular recently, specifically on design systems.

I commute 14 miles each day by bicycle, and I recently started listening to audiobooks during my ride. I'm trying some biographies right now, which is kind of new for me.

## At Home

Most of my personal time is spent working on [Gridmaster](https://gridmaster.io), which is [an Excel addin for learning Excel](https://gridmaster.io/). It's a real, income-producing business. I'm trying to figure out how to grow it.

I'm serving as an Assistant Scoutmaster and I work with the 12-13 year old boys at church. Sundays I spend all day with my family.
