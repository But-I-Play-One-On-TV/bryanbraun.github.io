<p>Whenever I read a book, I add it to the list below, give it a rating, and write up a brief synopsis describing the book and the insights it brought me. Is there a book you think I'll like? <a href="/contact">Let me know</a> and maybe it will show up here soon.</p>
<p><small>Inspired by the Derek Sivers booklist.</small></p>

<div class="books">
  {% for book in site.books %}
    <div class="book">
      <h2>{{ book.title }}</h2>
      <div>Author: {{ book.author }}</div>
      <div>Rating: {{ book.rating }}</div>
      {{ book.content }}
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
