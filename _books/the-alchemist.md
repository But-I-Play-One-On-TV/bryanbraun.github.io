This is a short, fictional story of a boy who leaves his lifestyle as a shepherd to search for a treasure, learning a series of life-lessons along the way. It's a popular book, and I can kind-of see why. Throughout his journey, the boy reflects on topics like fate, choice, and wisdom, which gives it a feel similar to "The Little Prince." The story has a lot of religious and mystical overtones, which I enjoyed until they became a bit overbearing. Overall, not a bad book.
