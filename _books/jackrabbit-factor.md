This is a short, casual book that questions the assumptions of the majority of people pursuing a career. It uses a fictional story to make an argument for going against the conventional money-earning process and building your own career as an entrepreneur. I thought it was decent. You can download it legally for free [here](http://www.thoughtsalive.com/mainpage.php) (though I'd recommend using a [disposible email address](https://www.google.com/search?q=disposable+email) if you don't want spam).
