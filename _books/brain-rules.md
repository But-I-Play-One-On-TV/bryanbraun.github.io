Brain Rules is a book about the human brain. In it, the author proposes suggestions on how we can better learn, function, and thrive, based on research takeaways from the field of neuroscience. He effectively walks a delicate line between between losing the reader byÂ getting too technical about the science, and not building up enough support for his claims. Major takeaways: It's really important to get enough sleep, repetition is critical in memory, and most teaching and learning isn't effective (though there is lots you can do to improve that).
