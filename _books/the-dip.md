This book discusses when to quit, and when to keep pushing. It's short, memorable, and wise. So often we hear the quotes about NEVER, EVER, QUIT, or we hear the contrarian pop-pieces about "actually, winners quit often." This book straddles the divide and discusses the whole topic with the attention and subtlety it deserves. Simply fantastic.
