This was my first time reading Gary Vee. I was hesitant because I've seen bits and pieces of his stuff online and his style didn't really appeal to me. But I gave it a shot and honestly I found it pretty useful. First, it's clear that he walks the walk, and I respect that. But the big takeaway I got from the book is to not overlook social media. Social media allows you to build an audience and a relationship with that audience, which can give you a huge advantage over the big faceless incumbents you are competing with. However: you can't be faceless. You have to be real, authentic, and incredibly dedicated. Good things to consider.
