This book wins the award of "most likely, of all the books I've read, to be found in the forbidden section of the Hogwarts library". It's formatted as an advice book but I was shocked at how unashamed it was in giving advice like "Conceal your intentions" and "Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit." It backed up this advice with real-life examples, which were interesting, but were often hundreds of years old. My take: tactics like these may have worked in the past but if you try to pull this stuff in today's hyper-connected world, you're going to get eaten alive. There were a couple of gems, but overall the book was disgusting.
