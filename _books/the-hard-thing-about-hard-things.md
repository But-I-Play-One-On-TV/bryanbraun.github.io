This is basically a book for Silicon Valley CEOs about the challenges of growing and managing a fast-moving technology company. I didn't realize how focused it would be on CEOs... it goes into great detail on things like hiring, firing, and organizational structure (drawing heavily from Ben's personal experiences). Still, it was entertaining, and I enjoyed his perspectives. My favorite concept: Salespeople make sales, developers make products, and CEOs make decisions. A CEO must be able to make great decisions quickly and without much research, or the company will come to a grinding halt.
