As a Mailchimp user, I know firsthand how good Aarron Walter’s work was, so it was with high expectations that I read this book. It did not disappoint. We all know about companies or that just feel fresh, cool, and interesting, but we often don’t realize how much intentional design work goes into every customer-company interface (including the website) in order to build that impression. Walter explains how to build these impressions, and uncovers the principles of psychology and human behavior that we must understand in order to do so. Great book.
