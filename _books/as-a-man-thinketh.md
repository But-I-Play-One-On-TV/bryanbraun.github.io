It's been 10 years since I last read this book, and I knew it was short so I decided to give it another spin. The name comes from the Proverb: "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he". The book simply expands on that principle, discussing how a habit of correct thinking can produce positive results in your life. At this point in my life the idea is no longer novel, but the book remains a nice brief introduction to the principle.
