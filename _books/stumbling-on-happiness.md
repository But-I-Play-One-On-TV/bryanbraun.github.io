I thought this would be a book on "how to be happy" but it wasn't. It was all about the human biases that affect our happiness in unexpected ways (for example, the flawed way we reconstruct memories). The book was witty, scientific, and right up my alley. The biggest takeaway for me was to always favor action over inaction, because humans seldom regret taking action, _even when the outcome is demonstrably bad_. Our minds bend over backwards to find positive outcomes for our past actions, which is why you hear so many people say things like "If I had to do it over, I wouldn't change a thing". The opposite happens for inaction... we regret it instead of justifying it. Fascinating stuff.
