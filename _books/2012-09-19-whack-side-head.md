This book is pure sillyness, printed and bound. The author discusses how our brains get stuck in a rut, and how the only way to get out is to break free of the norms of thought. The book teaches the principle by explaining the concept, then sharing puzzles, ideas, exercies, jokes, and the most fantastic, shamelessly nonsensical illustrations you've ever seen. It really is a fun read. For a sneak preview of the content, check out <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/03/06/whack-side-head" target="_blank" title="Bryan Discusses a Whack on the Side of the Head">this post</a> I wrote a while back.
