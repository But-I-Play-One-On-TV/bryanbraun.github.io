This is a short, casual book that questions the assumptions of the majority of people pursuing a career. It uses a fictional story to make an argument for going against the conventional money-earning process and building your own career as an entrepreneur. I thought it was decent. You can download it legally for free <a href="http://www.thoughtsalive.com/mainpage.php" target="_blank" title="The Jackrabbit Factor download">here</a> (though I'd recommend using a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=disposable+email" target="_blank" title="Dispostable is good, I hear">disposible email address</a> if you don't want spam).
