This book is called Overlap, because it talks about shifting your career by "overlapping" what you currently do with what you want to do. It spends a lot of time giving guidance around starting an entrepreneurial project, based on the experience of the author (who has done it a number of times is his life). The author shares a lot of experiences which gives him credibility. Not everything applied to me, but many parts rung true and I enjoyed reading it.
