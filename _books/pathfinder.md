This is a phenomenal book on how to choose a career. It is extremely detailed, giving you every step you need to take to find your passion, discover how to get paid to do it, qualify yourself for it, and then land a job. That being said, I am certain that this book is not for everyone. It's written as a workbook that explains clear principles and then loads you up with tons of exercises and homework. If you aren't willing to do the work on the side, don't even bother. If you are (and you ought to be, as you will likely be working for the rest of your life) then there is no better book for reaching that goal.
