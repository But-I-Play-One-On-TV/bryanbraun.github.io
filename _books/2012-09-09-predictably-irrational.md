This book discusses the irrational things that humans do everyday. While the premise sounds great, the book failed to deliver. I loved the concept, and select parts of the book, (like how we are often lured by the concept of 'free', to make poor choices) but my expectations were high and the book failed to "WOW" me. The tie to behavioral economics was weak and the author used an appeal to shock value that was rather unpleasent. To the author's credit, I felt his assumptions (and conclusions) were interesting and backed by adequate research.
