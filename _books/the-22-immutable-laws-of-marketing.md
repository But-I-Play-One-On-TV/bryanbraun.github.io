This book was all about going to battle in the world of ideas, and how to make your message potent and profitable. It contained tons of real-life examples, and I really enjoyed the demonstration of how perception is reality. Another interesting point: once a competitor owns an idea in the minds of people, it's gone. The only thing you can do is use it against them. The book was certainly a bit dated, and it mostly applied to huge mass-market products (not really my thing), but it was still an interesting read.
