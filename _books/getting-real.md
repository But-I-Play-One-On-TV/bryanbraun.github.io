This is a short book by the folks at 37 Signals on smart principles for building a web application. It talks about product design ("build less"), product roadmaps ("plan less"), programming ("write less code"), copywriting ("write fewer words"), staffing ("hire less"), and more. As you can see, the major theme is to stay lean and do less unnecessary work. I ate it up. It's an older book, but the concepts are ageless. You can [buy a physical copy][1], or [download the e-book for free online][2].
