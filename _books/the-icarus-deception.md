This book is classic Seth Godin. In it, he recounts the classic story of [Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus), explaining that one part of the story is often forgotten: in addition to being warned not to fly too high, Icarus was also warned not to fly too low. According to Seth, 'flying too low' is the far greater danger for modern creatives. The book continues by providing advice and encouragement to those taking risks, making connections, and creating "art" (which he defines very loosely). It's a solid read if you like Seth's other books.
