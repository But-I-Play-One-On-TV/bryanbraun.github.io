Somehow, this book managed to mashup a futuristic world centered around immersive virtual reality with an entourage of 1980s gaming nostalgia. The storytelling was good, and I found myself drawn into it, despite the fact that I knew I wasn't the optimal reader. If you were about 10 years older than me and in the gamer/D&D scene, then you'd find this book impossible to put down.
