Everybody has something to say but saying it does nothing if your audience doesn't remember it. Made to Stick revolves around what makes an idea "sticky," or unforgettable. In this book, [the authors](http://www.heathbrothers.com) spend time looking at the the stickiest messages: urban legends, radio jingles, unforgettable advertisements and more. Their question is, what separates the glut of forgettable messages with those that you can't get out of your head? Through their research, they find a set of principles that can make your message stick with the audience, whether you are a marketer, educator, manager, or parent. This book is stellar and using its principles to make my own messages sticky has been invaluable in my life.
