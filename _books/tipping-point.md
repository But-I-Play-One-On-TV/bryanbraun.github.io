This is by far my favorite Malcolm Gladwell book. In it, he looks at what causes something to, for lack of a better phrase, "go viral." As a subtle distinction, he isn't just looking at the contentâ€¦ he's looking at the networks. He finds that the ability for an idea to "tip" and spread has a lot to do with the people who pass this idea around. For a fledgling idea, certain type of people -- connectors, mavens, and salesmen -- can have a huge influence on whether it takes off or languishes in irrelevance.
