This book has been on my radar for a while but when I heard that Richard Thaler won the Nobel prize, I decided to just read it. It talks about decision architects (the people in charge of setting up systems where other people have to make decisions), and how they can thoughtfully _design_ those systems to produce better outcomes. With this framework they propose solutions to dozens of tricky problems across education, goverment, healthcare, and more. It gave me a sense of how underoptimized most of the systems in the world are... and how most are the way the are only because nobody has come up with anything better.
