I've enjoyed a lot of the science fiction I've read recently, so when [Bill Gates recommended this book][1], I picked it up. I was excited because it seemed similar to the Martian -- a terrible disaster occurs in space and humans must use a lot of ingenuity (and technology that could exist today) to preserve human life. I was not disappointed either. I loved the storyline, the detailed technical challenges, and seeing what humanity might look like when projected into the future from an odd set of initial conditions. The only downside was that the book was so long. There were a number of parts that dragged on and subplots that I could have done without. That being said, I'd find myself recommending it to others with little reservation.
