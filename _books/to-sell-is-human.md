This book discusses how changes in the world have changed the profession of sales. For one thing, everyone's in sales now because whether you're a writer, project manager, teacher, or doctor, you need to be able to persuade, negotiate, and sell your ideas. Another point is that the traditional (and stereotypical) approaches to sales simply don't work as well in today's world. People are more informed, more connected, and more suspicious than ever before. The most successful salespeople of today are those who listen, serve, and value long-term relationships (instead of pushing to close single transactions). This book was right up my alley and I appreciate the perspective it gave me.
