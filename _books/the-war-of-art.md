Steven Pressfield writes about the challenge of producing creative work, including the foes we must overcome and the allies we must recruit. Perhaps it is most famous for it's identification of the resistanceâ€¦ that tendency in all of us to postpone, procrastinate and find every reason to prevent ourselves from finishing the work. I felt like some parts were gold, and other parts weren't. A good read nonetheless.
