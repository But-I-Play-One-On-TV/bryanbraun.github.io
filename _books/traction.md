If you're at an early stage company that needs help getting customers, *read this book*. It takes the whole vast universe of sales and marketing and distills it down into [19 marketing channels][1] and [a framework][2] you can use to figure out which ones you should focus on. There's a lot of ways you *could* get customers but this helps you prioritize the most promising ones, validate them with data, and double-down on the ones that deliver results. What's more, the book pulls in experts to explain each channel and share stories of how they got results using it. "Traction" was great all-around and you can expect to find me recommending it to others in the future.
