Change is hard, so what do you do if you want to instigate a change? That's the topic of Switch. Chip and Dan Heath use the analogy of a **rider** sitting a top an **elephant** walking down a **path**, saying that in order to change course you need to **direct the rider**, **motivate the elephant**, and **shape the path**. In this analogy, the rider represents our logical selves, the elephant, our emotional and instinctive selves, and the path our environment. The authors provide the reader with tools for assisting all three parties in making the switch, no matter what kind of change you are trying to make. I could talk about it for hours, so needless to say, I thought it was fantastic.
