Weighing in at 900+ pages, this tome is an incredibly comprehensive guide to the javascript language and how it works in the web browser. I read it through while taking notes and making flashcards (using [this technique][1]) and found the process to be quite fruitful, even though it took months to get all the way through it. While some parts of the book show it's age (I learned more than I needed to know about frames), most of it is still applicable. I'm confident that it will be a great reference for years to come.
