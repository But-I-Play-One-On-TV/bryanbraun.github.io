This book is subtitled: "Advice on careers, finance, and life from Harvard Business School's Class of 1963". It seemed like a clever idea for a book, and I always like hearing the perspectives of those who are near the end of their careers and lives. The main takeaway for me was: nothing will bring you more satisfaction than strong relationships with family and friends. Also, career success can be a worthy pursuit, as long as it is kept in perspective. The book is printed, but you can also [read the whole thing online][1] (which is what I did).
