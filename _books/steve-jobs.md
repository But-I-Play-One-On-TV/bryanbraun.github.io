This is the canonical Steve Jobs biography, and it didn't disappoint. Steve had such an extreme personality that he almost seemed like a caricature. I got the impression that Jobs could just have easily turned out an erratic homeless man as the founder and CEO of Apple. Following a character like that, as he transformed one industry after another is quite the journey. A fantastic read all around.
