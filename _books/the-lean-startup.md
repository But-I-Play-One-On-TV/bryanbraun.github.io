This book is popular in entrepreneur circles, so I'm glad I got around to reading it. Its big thing is applying the principles of [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) to entrepreneurial startups (with an emphasis on software companies). The book was way more methodical and scientific than I was expecting. It's basic promise was that building a successful startup doesn't have to be just luck... that it could be systematized through experimentation, iterative learning, and strategic pivots. You could get really deep into implementing these approaches, but even if you don't, the concepts are great mental models for developing anything new.
