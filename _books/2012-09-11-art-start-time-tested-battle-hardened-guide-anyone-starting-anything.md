This is a fun little book about separating out the things start-ups should focus on from the things they shouldn't bother with. With a premise like that, it's easy to see why this book would be invaluable to entrepreneurs with limited time. The book was good, with my only regret being that it zeroed in on business startups, leaving no room to extrapolate out principles for "anyone starting anything" (as the book's subtitle claimed to do).
