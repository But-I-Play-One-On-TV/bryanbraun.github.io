This short book (in the public domain -- <a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/kynepete1225712257-8.html" target="_blank" title="The Go-getter">download it for free</a>) is a very readable parable about an underdog who demonstrates what it's like to be determined to succeed. It's an age-old story of how nothing is more powerful than a motivated person who is driven to keep their commitment, no matter what. If you want to be invaluable, read this book, and train yourself to be like that person. Period.
