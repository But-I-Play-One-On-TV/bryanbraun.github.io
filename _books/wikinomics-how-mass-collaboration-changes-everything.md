This book is about the power of online collaboration and its impact on business and society. The premise of this book is solid but I was cringing all the way through it. It was dry, repetitive, outdated, and full of buzzwordy jargon. To quote another reviewer, it was "full of consultantese". To be fair, I (as a web developer) am probably not in the intended target audience, nor was this book designed to be relevant 10 years after it was published. Regardless, I can't, in good conscience, recommend it.
