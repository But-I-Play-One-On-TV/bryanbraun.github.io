Have you ever bought something only to later wonder why, when you didn't even need the thing? We are always being persuaded to do illogical things, and this book digs into the specific techniques that "Compliance Practitioners" (think Marketers, Sales People, Activists, etc.) use in order to influence our thinking and judgement. It's chock full of great examples (like tupperware parties, suicide cults, hazings, and tip jars), and important principles (like reciprocation, social proof, authority, and scarcity). Despite the usefulness of the book, it took me a while to work through it. My mind was on other topics, so I think the timing just wasn't quite right. If you're interested in the topic, though, I do recommend it.
