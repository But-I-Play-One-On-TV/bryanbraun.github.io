This book discusses how small iterative "bets" can lead to discovery and innovation, citing examples across several industries. The concepts were solid and the stories were good, but there's nothing revolutionary the book or concept. It's basically another name for agile product development and other lean methodologies that have been the standard practice in Silicon Valley for the last 10+ years. If you are in an industry that doesn't already work like this, then there's a lot to learn here. If not, then I'd recommend something else.
