There's nothing remarkable about a brown cow, but if you saw a purple cow... now that's something worth talking about. In this book Seth Godin explains how selling products the old way (getting an ordinary product and spending piles of money on advertising it to the masses) doesn't work anymore. Instead he directs his readers to ingore the masses, focus on a niche, be polarizing, and more. My favorite insight: the opposite of "remarkable" is not "bad"... it's "very good" (since even "bad" gets people talking). This book is a classic and despite being written over 15 years ago, its principles are more true than ever before.
