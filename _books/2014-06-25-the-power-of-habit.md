This book looks at the science and psychology of habits and how they shape our lives. The idea that you can control your habits, essentially defining what your own cognitive autopilot looks like, is pretty powerful. The stories were entertaining, although they were a bit disjointed and it tooks some acrobatics to connect them back to the main message of the book. Many concepts, like *keystone habits* and the *cue-routine-reward loop*, made for great takeaways.
