  This is a book about an incredible shift that quietly took place at the turn of the century when web technology enabled the world to collaborate on an unprecedented scale. This led to the uprooting of many established business models, which gave way to a wave of efficiency and globalization. I found it very relevant, even 10 years after it was written. It's a big book, and it covers every thing from open source, to supply chains, to Al Qaeda, but it went by quickly because I really enjoyed it.
