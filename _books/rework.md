This book provides an no-nonsense approach to running a modern business... one that rightfully questions the industry's antiquated traditions (like resumes, estimates, and endless meetings). This new approach describes a world where financing is plan Z, press releases are spam, and employees are trusted, given autonomy, and told to go home at 5pm. The principles both make sense (I found myself nodding with nearly every page) and they work (Their company has annual profits in the millions). It's like the anti-Dilbert. I don't think I could praise this book enough.
