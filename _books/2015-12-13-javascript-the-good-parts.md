Mixed feelings about the book. The way it approached Javascript was interesting, thinking of it as a flawed language with a subset of features that is powerful and useful, if the pitfalls are avoided. Given the popularity of the book, I'm sure that concept was groundbreaking at the time it came out. But as a learning tool, the book was really rough. The section on regular expressions falls short, and the encyclopedic list of array methods belonged in a different book (or onÂ MDN). His flow diagrams (comprising most of the diagrams the whole book) are only useful if you want to write some sort of parser or linter (like he did...). I wish this book was a 20 page ebook explaining the main idea then simply listing out the good parts & bad parts (with the reasoning behind each one). There are a lot better books out there for learning Javascript these days.
