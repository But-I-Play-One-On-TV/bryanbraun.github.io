This book does a good of teaching the principles behind thoughtful web design. Its focus on the fundamentals allows it to remain relevant despite the speed and which the industry moves. It covers a little bit of everything: color theory, typography, white space, grids, and more. The author has classical design training, and perhaps that contributed to the slight tone of superiority, but all in all I thought it was pretty good.
