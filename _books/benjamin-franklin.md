This was not the book about Benjamin Franklin I wanted to read. It started to give me an idea of his character, but ended up glossing over the first 70 years of his life in the first quarter of the book. The rest of the text was spent documenting his contribution to the American revolution in great detail. I'm sure there's a place for that, but it's not what I was expecting (especially after reading Isaacson's comprehensive biographies of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci). Given how many questions I still have, I'm planning on holding out for another biography on Franklin that covers the man more to my satisfaction.
