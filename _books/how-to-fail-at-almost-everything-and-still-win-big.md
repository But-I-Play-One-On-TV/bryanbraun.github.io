This is a biography / self-help book by Scott Adams, the artist behind the Dilbert comic strip. In it, he talks a lot about failure, and setting up systems for learning from it. His way of thinking through problems with optimisim, pragmatism, and questioning made a lot of sense to me. Not everything in the book is gold, but overall I was impressed with it.
