In this book Ed Catmull tells the history of Pixar and how they maintain the creative culture needed to consistently produce breakout animated films. The story was way engaging; I loved the examples he shared of issues they had in their movies during production and how they went about transforming them into the films I knew and loved. He also makes some great points about the importance of candor and trust, describing how they developed these qualities and used them to help turn around Disney's failing animation studio. A great read all around.
