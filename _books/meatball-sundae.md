This book is about old companies trying to adopt the "new marketing" (online marketing) and how they often fail. Seth Godin argues that these attempts are like taking meatballs and putting them in an ice-cream Sunday. It just doesn't work. Seth continues by sharing examples of how internet-native companies succeed with online marketing, making the point that older companies should reinvent themselves to fit the "new marketing," instead of the other way around. This book is over 10 years old now and it felt pretty dated but it was an interesting peek into the time capsule.
