This Is a short, fictional story of a boy who leaves his home on a small asteriod and goes exploring, visiting other "planets" (including Earth), and meeting various people. What makes the story interesting is how he learns about each creature he meets and assesses their priorities and lifestyle with a child-like perspective. In this way, The Little Prince brings fresh insight to topics like love, loss, friendship, vanity, selfishness, and fickle human pursuits. It was a nice short read, with a lot of richness and symbolism... definately worth your time.
