A [short, free, online book][1], full of advice about starting a company. The focus leans towards Silicon-valley-esque venture backed technology companies, but there's lots of wisdom that applies to all sorts of companies. It reads like a document that has been ruthlessly edited until there is no superficial filler content remaining; Every sentence is meaningful and intentional. A great read if you are in the startup world, or interested in it.
