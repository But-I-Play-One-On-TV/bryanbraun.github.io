I read this right after Walter Issacson's "Steve Jobs" and it was interesting to compare Musk with Jobs. Both have brought huge advances to their industries by being relentlessly focused, hiring the best in the world, and providing a vision that captivates the public. Neither were motivated by money... they wanted to build a better world. The book shines as it shows in gut-wrenching detail what awful struggles Musk had to go through through to bring his companies to life. The biggest issue with this book is it was written too soon! History continues to be written, and Musk moves so fast that it's clear that the book was dated within a year of its writing. A more complete biography will be written one day, but in the mean time, this one was pretty good.
