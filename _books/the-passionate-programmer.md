This is the career book I never knew I needed when I got into programming. It's full of great perspectives, each one written succinctly and highlighted with examples. Some of the examples are a little dated (lots of references to Java) but, if anything, that shows how timeless the advice is. Several of my recent blog posts were inspired by things I read that just "rang true" to me. I expect to recommend this book to other developers in the future.
