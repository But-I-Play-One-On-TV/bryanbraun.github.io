This book is a collection of blog posts, each one using math, physics, and chemistry to answer highly absurd questions. For example: *What would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% the speed of light? (Hint: It's not pretty).* It was entertaining, and even educational. I wish my high school physics teacher taught like this. As a bonus, most of the posts are available to read online at [what-if.xkcd.com][1].
