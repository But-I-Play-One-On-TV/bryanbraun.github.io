This book outlines a framework for managing everything you have to do in your life, touting benefits like increased productivity, and reduced stress. It's promotes getting lists of poorly defined tasks out of your head, breaking them down into actionable items, and placing them in a trusted system that you review regularly. The book gets into the detailed steps of how to set up such a system in your life, which I really liked. Some people swear by the methodology so I decided to give it a try. Already, I can see improvement--the part about managing inboxes is already paying dividends (my gmail inbox is empty at the end of just about every day now). We'll see how it continues to work going forward.
