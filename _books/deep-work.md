This book is all about one idea: that we live in a world of distraction, and thus, if you cultivate the ability to focus and do deep work, you will be able to outperform your peers. That concept rings true to me and was communicated clearly throughout the book. I went through the book rather slowly because it was a lot to digest and wasn't the most entertaining of topics, but I still loved it. This book is like vegetables for your brain.
