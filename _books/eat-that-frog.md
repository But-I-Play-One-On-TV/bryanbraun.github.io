The subtitle is "21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time". There's some good stuff in here for sure. One example: because we will never finish everything, we should learn to be ok with leaving the low-value things undone. Another one: a productivity-win brings confidence which results in more productivity (whereas, a productivity-failure brings shame which results in less). The biggest takeaway for me is that much of the work in being productive must be done before you even start working. That's being well rested, eating well, exercising, planning your day, turning off your phone, silencing notifications, and getting hyped. The book has some hyperbole here and there but it's otherwise pretty good.
