This little book is exactly what it sounds like: a collection of techniques on how to stress less and live better. Each technique provides small ways to choose patience, tolerance, empathy, and compassion, over the stress-inducing alternatives. Peace and balance may not be celebrated as American virtues (like, perhaps, independence and hard-work), but maybe that's why books like this one are so important.
