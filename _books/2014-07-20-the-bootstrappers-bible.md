This is a free Seth Godin ebook ([download here][1]) on the topic of creating a business. It was a short read, with a smattering of advise on various business fundamentals. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a "bible" but it definitely had some gems. For example: Do not ignore the money. You have nothing if you don't survive. No money, no business. Another one: Don't try to innovate on the business model (there are plenty of other places to innovate, so you should stick with a proven model).
