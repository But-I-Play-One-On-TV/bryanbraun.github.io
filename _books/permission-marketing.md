This book is about how the internet changed the media landscape such that "interruption marketing" (think TV commercials and banner ads) don't work anymore. Instead, the author proposes we embrace "Permission marketing," by providing so much value to our customers that they give us permission to connect with them. This new model brings a whole new set of challenges but also a ton of opportunities to build trust and loyalty. This Seth Godin classic was short, sweet, and incredibly relevant despite being nearly 20 years old.
