I really enjoyed getting to know Leonardo over the weeks it took to go through this book. The man had an insatiable curiosity, which fueled his inventions and discoveries, but he was also flawed. His notebooks were packed with discoveries that ended up needing to be rediscovered (some hundreds of years later) just because he didn't get around to publishing them. In fact, "not getting around to finishing things" was a hallmark of da Vinci. The book spent a great deal on his painting which was difficult to appreciate via audiobook, but enlightening nonetheless. What a man.
