This is a book about underdogs, but mostly about how the narrative around underdogs is all wrong. Gladwell's big idea is that the strongest opponents are weak by definition, and "underdogs" have incredible advantages. David beat Goliath because of his size, not in spite of his size. In classic Gladwell fashion he explores the concept through a series of stories while resisting the urge to tie everything together into a single unified theory. It was a good read that came at the perfect time for me.
