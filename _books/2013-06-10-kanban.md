So, this isn't pop-psychology, or a business book, and it certainly isn't on the NY Times bestseller list, but if you're into software project management methodologies and you haven't heard of Kanban, this book is for you. It explains how the Kanban system used by manufacturing organizations to control the flow of physical parts can be translated to the software industry. The big take-away is that by using a "pull" system and keeping work-in-progress limits, you never have people overloaded with work, and you never have idle developers. It's hard to make this kind of material riveting, but he did a good job of making it understandable.
