If you weren't aware, this is THE authoritative book on web usability, and has been for over 15 years. You'd expected it to feel rather dated, but I was pleasantly surprised by how applicable everything still is. In some ways, I felt like I had already read it, because so many of his ideas have influenced the practice of good web design over the years. Things like sticking to design conventions, eliminating unnecessary words, and proper visual hierarchy were welcome reminders to me. In short, this is still a good (and short!) foundational book on web usability.
