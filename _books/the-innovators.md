This is basically a biography of all the influential people in the history of computing crammed into one book. It was great to finally get the backstory of all these names I hear so often in my industry, from Ada Lovelace to Jimmy Wales. The number of people featured made it feel like a whirlwind tour but the benefit was that I could clearly see the common threads of modern innovation. Most notably, that the true innovator isn't the first to invent but the first to successfully bring the innovation to market. This is usually accomplished by a team of passionate people with complementary skills (think Jobs and Wozniak), rather than a lone genius.
