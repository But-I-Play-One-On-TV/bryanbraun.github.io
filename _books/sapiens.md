It seemed like everybody whose book recommendations I trusted was recommending this book, so I decided to read it. Overall, it was pretty good. It introduced some fascinating ideas, like the idea that humanity has periodically fallen into species-wide traps that are inescapable only because they are favored by natural selection (like the agricultural revolution). I enjoyed the parts about early humans the most. In general, the author was great at looking at humans as if from the perspective of some alien observer, which allowed him to make all sorts of surprising observations.
