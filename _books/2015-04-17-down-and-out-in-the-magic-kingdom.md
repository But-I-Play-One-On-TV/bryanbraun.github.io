I think that somewhere out there, there is a science fiction book about a non-dystopian post-scarcity society that I would find absolutely phenomenal. This wasn't it. Oh, the book had interesting parts--I liked the discussion of this future society, and how their advancements had impacted the fundamental elements of life, like love, death, money, entertainment, and social status. Ultimately, though, this discussion took backstage to a plot-line about a feud between competing coworkers at Disneyland, which was difficult for me to take seriously.
