A mission to the surface of Mars is interrupted when a dust storm forces the astronauts to evacuate back to Earth, leaving behind Mark Watney a crewmate lost in the storm and presumed dead. When Mark comes to, he finds himself alone in a battle for survival on a planet that's hostile to human life. The book had everything. A likable character, a gripping story, and no cheap tricks. Every detail was approached scientifically, forcing Mark to hack the available technology and calculate his way to a plausible rescue. The book was impossible to put down.
