This is one of those classic "millions of copies sold" self-help books written in the 1950's, so you should prepare to suspend some judgement on how dated/cheesy it is. With that in mind, I really enjoyed it. It had a lot of good things to say about the attitudes that leaders adopt. And honestly, I simply enjoyed having a daily stream of positivity as part of my morning routine. I could feel it improving my attitude and it helped me realize how harmful it is to constantly expose myself to the negativity of the news cycle (and my twitter feed). Part of thinking big is managing your attitude, and one of my big takeaways is to be more deliberate about that.
