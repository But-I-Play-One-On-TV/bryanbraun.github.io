This book provides a framework for decision making, helping its readers to avoid the fallacies us humans are prone to make. The stories embedded in the narrative weren't bad but the book was ultimately forgettable. In fact, a few months after finishing it, I forgot that I had read it, and I subsequently checked it out from the library a second time! Maybe it would have been more memorable if I had read it while grappling with a big decision. Whatever the reason, the book failed to have an impact on me.
