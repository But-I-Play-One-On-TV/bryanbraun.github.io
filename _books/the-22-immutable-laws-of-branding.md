This book is about what makes a brand strong. For each branding principle it shares real-world examples. Some examples haven't held up well over time (like all the praise for Toys R Us). I got the sense that the book was targeted towards marketing VPs of huge companies. The book made a few interesting points about brand dilution and first-mover advantage, but it ultimately wasn't that relevant to me and was therefore pretty forgettable.
