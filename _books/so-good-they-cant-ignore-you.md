This book seeks to answer the question, "How do you get into a career that you love?" To do this, Cal builds a novel framework for thinking about about work, one where instead of pursuing your passion, you focus on building skills. In doing so, you collect "career capital" that you can exchange for progressively more control and mission-driven work over the years. I've got to say, this approach just clicked with me, tying together a lot of loose concepts in my head. Fantastic book for people starting their careers. I wish I could give it 6 stars!
