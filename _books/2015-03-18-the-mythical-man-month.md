The best way to describe this book is “one man’s reflections on how difficult it is to accurately predict how long it will take to build a very large software project.” He uses a lot of examples from building operating systems in the 70 and 80s which made it difficult for me to relate to, especially when he gets technical. Still, it was valuable to get a sense of how difficult these kinds of problems are, and see some approaches to handling it.
