This book is about snap judgments. It discusses how, in many cases, the conclusions made from snap judgments can be more accurate than those made through a long and thoughtful process. Like Gladwell's other books that I've read, it was full of interesting stories from an entire spectrum of human experience. Also like his other books, the stories weren't cohesive, came to all sorts of different conclusions, and didn't leave me with any grand takeaways. The result was an interesting book on an interesting topic that failed to inspire me or expand my vision.
