This is a fun little story about 2 guys and their (mis)adventures hiking the appalacian trail. Along the way, the book folds in the story of the trail itself, which illustrates the tension between the nature and civilization throughout its history. The story brings a mix of insight and deprecating humor, making it a fun read.
