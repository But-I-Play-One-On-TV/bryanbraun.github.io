This is a short, engaging book covering the story of Derek Sivers' business CDBaby, and the unconventional principles that fueled its success. One of the key points is this idea that your business is your own little world where you make all the rules. Instead of pattern-matching with what you think a typical business should look like, do whatever you think will make your customers happy. A great read about business creativity and questioning convention.
