This book is straight up weird, but I kind of liked it too. I picked it up because it was referenced in [this amazing podcast interview with Terry Crews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw4nhhSr58k). Ostensibly, it's a self-help book with a focus on how to use thinking to create your reality, similar to "Think and Grow Rich" or "As a Man Thinketh" (so far, so good). But unlike those books, this one was abstract, dense, and lacking narrative... kind of like reading Proverbs or the Tao Te Ching. It also had this air of metaphysics about it, using self-defined laws to reconcile elements of Christianity with empiricism (with mixed success). Overall, it had some great gems but it was definitely unconventional.
