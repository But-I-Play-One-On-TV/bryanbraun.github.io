Writer has been ported to Drupal 8!

It's still a development branch because Drupal 8 still has some kinks to work out, but all things considered, the theme is working great. Go ahead, give it a test drive at <a href="https://drupal.org/project/writer" target="_blank">the Writer project page on Drupal.org</p>.
