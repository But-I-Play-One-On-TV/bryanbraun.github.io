We control inputs.

And that's really frustrating because we want so desperately to control outcomes. We want the rock-hard abs, the luxury car, the vacation in Hawaii, or complete freedom over our time.

And sometimes, we convince ourselves that if we work really hard and learn really fast than maybe, just maybe, we might be able to control outcomes.

But we can't.

We can influence outcomes. We can increase their probabilities (especially in the long term). But we don't control them.

The world will grade you on your outcomes. Unfairly. The world demands results.

But when it comes time to grade ourselves, we should grade ourselves on our inputs. It's the only way to get the amount of credit we actually deserve. Not too much and not too little.
