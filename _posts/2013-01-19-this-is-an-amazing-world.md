Last month I made <a href="http://drupal.org/project/writer" title="Writer: A Blogging Theme for Developers">my first open source contribution</a>. You can read about the project in detail <a href="/2013/01/19/writer-a-blogging-theme-for-developers/" title="Introducing Writer">here</a>, but I just wanted to point out something amazing.

I wrote most of the code in November and [submitted it for review][1] in December. It was first tested by [a guy in Pakistan][2], and with his feedback I made changes. Then it was tested by [a guy in Boston][3]. Once again, feedback and changes. Finally, it was tested and approved by [a guy in Austria][4], and promoted to full project status by [a guy in Germany][5].

While I waited to get feedback, I also tested code for [a guy in Spain][6], [a guy in San Francisco][7], and [a guy in the United Arab Emirates][8].

When was the last time you collaborated with 7 people from 6 different countries, ad hoc, over a two week period, to bring forward some common work?

This is an amazing world we live in.
