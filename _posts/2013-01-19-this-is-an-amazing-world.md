Last month I made <a href="http://drupal.org/project/writer" target="_blank" title="Writer: A Blogging Theme for Developers">my first open source contribution</a>. You can read about the project in detail <a href="http://writer.bryanbraun.com/blog/introducing-writer" target="_blank" title="Introducing Writer">here</a>, but I just wanted to point out something amazing.

I wrote most of the code in November and [submitted it for review][1] in December. It was first tested by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/2225984" target="_blank">a guy in Pakistan</a>, and with his feedback I made changes. Then it was tested by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/207723" target="_blank">a guy in Boston</a>. Once again, feedback and changes. Finally, it was tested and approved by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/262198" target="_blank">a guy in Austria</a>, and promoted to full project status by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/36942" target="_blank">a guy in Germany</a>.

While I waited to get feedback, I also tested code for <a href="http://drupal.org/user/699418" target="_blank">a guy in Spain</a>, [a guy in San Francisco][2], and [a guy in the United Arab Emirates][3].

When was the last time you collaborated with 7 people from 6 different countries, ad hoc, over a two week period, to bring forward some common work?

This is an amazing world we live in.
