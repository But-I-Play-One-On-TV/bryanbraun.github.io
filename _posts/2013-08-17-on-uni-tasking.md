<p class="p1">
  My goal for the month of July was "uni-tasking," or basically, the opposite of multi-tasking. To me, that meant being entirely dedicated to the activity at hand, whatever that activity was.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It took several forms for me:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    It meant closing my work email at home and closing my personal email at work.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    It meant running everything on my computer in full screen mode (by the way, if you're on a Mac <a href="https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt">this little free app</a> is a life-saver for managing that).
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    It meant turning off my phone when I was at church or on a date.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    It meant I established "<a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2013/07/29/kinds-of-time">kinds of time</a>" so I could be dedicated to family in the evenings and personal projects in the mornings.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">
  It certainly wasn't perfect. There's always that thing that crops up, declares itself an emergency, and demands you pay attention to it. But I totally caught the vision. I did more work, I did better work, and (most importantly) I felt better about what I was doing. I highly recommend you find what uni-tasking means for you and go give it a shot.
