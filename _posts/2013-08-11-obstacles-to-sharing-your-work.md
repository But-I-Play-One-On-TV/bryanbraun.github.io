<p class="p1">
  I suppose that for the common person there are two unanswered questions that make <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2013/08/10/change-the-world-with-5-more-effort" title="Change the world with 5 percent more effort">sharing your work</a> difficult.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1) Where will I put it? and<br />2) How will the person who is looking for it, find it?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I believe that the solution to both problems will become obvious over time. Google's starting to get really good at answering #2.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  As for #1 here are a couple suggestions:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    For code, put it on <a href="https://github.com/"><span class="s1">github</span></a> (though you'll need to <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git"><span class="s1">learn git</span></a>).
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For photography, put it on <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/help/1"><span class="s1">stockexchange</span></a>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For knowledge, put it on <a href="http://wikipedia.org/"><span class="s1">wikipedia</span></a> (or some other <a href="http://www.wikia.com/Wikia"><span class="s1">topic-specific wiki</span></a> out there)
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For questions, put them on <a href="http://www.quora.com/"><span class="s1">quora</span></a> or <a href="http://stackexchange.com/"><span class="s1">stackexchange</span></a>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For website templates, put them on <a href="http://www.opendesigns.org/"><span class="s1">opendesigns.org</span></a>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For music put it on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/"><span class="s1">soundcloud</span></a>, and consider applying <a href="http://help.soundcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/243852-what-is-creative-commons-"><span class="s1">the Creative Commons license</span></a>.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For nearly anything, start up a free blog with <a href="http://blogger.com/"><span class="s1">blogger</span></a> or <a href="http://wordpress.com/"><span class="s1">wordpress</span></a> and start putting stuff up there.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    For complete control over all your stuff. <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/contact"><span class="s1">Ask me</span></a> how to set up your own website so you can host it all yourself.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">
  I'm sure there are also communities for graphic design, CAD, architecture, animation, and other various topics. This list is just to show you that there are lots of places out there, if you look.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Again, with Google working on #2, where you put it is less important than the fact that you put it somewhere.
