<p class="p1">
  I get the sense that the internet (at least the parts that I'm familiar with) is learning how to share. It wasn't long ago that my Facebook, was all statuses. Now, my circle of friends are sharing more links, videos, and rich media than ever before.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  And that's important because the more we learn how to share, the more we empower great ideas to spread. It allows the small people doing great things in the corners of the internet to rise out of obscurity based on the merit of their work, instead of the just the connections that they have.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  What you share is a window into your personality. It is a vote of confidence in the creator. It's an expression of your gratitude. And it takes seven seconds.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So share. Share everything.
