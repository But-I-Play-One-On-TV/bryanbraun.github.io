  A couple weeks ago I got an email from <a href="http://sivers.org/">my role model</a>, with an answer to a question I was struggling with (I summarized <a href="http://www.bryanbraun.com/2013/09/03/my-3rd-place">his answer here</a>, in case you missed it). He didn't have to respond, but he did, and I'm very grateful. I liked him before, now I think is THE MAN.

  My takeaway: You can't do everything for everybody, and you'd be a fool to try. But if you're on the fence, err on the side of generosity.
