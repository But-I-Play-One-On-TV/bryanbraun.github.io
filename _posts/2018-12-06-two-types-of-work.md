There are two types of work:

1. **Figuring out what to do**
2. **Doing the thing**

Many jobs focus on just one of these. Most upper-level jobs are in the first category (where your work involves things like deciding where to put time and money). Most entry-level jobs are in the second category (where your work involves things like following a handbook).

Both types of work are difficult but for different reasons.

**Figuring out what to do** invites anxiety. It's emotional labor. You are burdened with the [infinite opportunity-cost]({{site.url}}/2014/07/21/the-relentless-increase-in-opportunity-costs/) of your time and money. Indecision is the worst type of failure.

**Doing the thing** invites strain. It's physical labor. It's [repetitive and boring]({{site.url}}/2016/02/08/don-hertzfeldt-on-creative-work/) and hard on your muscles and your eyes. It's a slog.

I've learned that when my motivation is low, it's usually because I need to do the first type of work. It's the [hardest](https://seths.blog/2011/05/hard-work-vs-long-work/) for me because my motivation dips when results are less tangible. But it's still important, valid, difficult work (something I need to keep telling myself).

Fortunately, the solution for both types of work is the same: deconstruct it. Keep breaking it up relentlessly into smaller and smaller pieces until it becomes possible.
