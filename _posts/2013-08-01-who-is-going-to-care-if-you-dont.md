<p class="p1">
  If you've convinced people to spend some of their time working on your project, then realize that nobody is going to care about it as much as you do.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  This will impact thousands of small decisions surrounding time usage, issue prioritization, and personal sacrifice. People have lives, families, and interests of their own. People have mental energy to conserve and emotional debt from other aspects of there lives. Nobody is going to put your project first as much as you would. Nobody.

  So if you don't really care about your project, you'd better start caring or move on.
