I was throwing out some old files when I stumbled across this paper. It's a page from the plan I made when I decided to switch careers during my senior year of college:

For years, when people have asked about my education, I've said something like, "by the time I graduated I preferred web programming to engineering, so I decided to switch careers." I've made it sound like it was so easy.

It wasn't. Switching careers was terrifying and it took a lot of unglamorous work and preparation to get where I wanted to go. I need to remind myself that it still will. It always will.
