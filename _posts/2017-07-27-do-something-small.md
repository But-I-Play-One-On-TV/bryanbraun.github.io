I was listening to [a podcast](https://tim.blog/2015/07/17/peter-diamandis-on-the-education-system/) the other day, when [the speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis) began to address this question I had often had: how does a normal person turn into a prolific innovator?

Here's what he said:

> I think the first thing I would do is, I would do something. And then I would do something bigger. And then something bigger. It's taking one step at a time.

> For me, my first effort was, really, getting a petition going to support Space when I was a freshman in college. Then I started a space organization called SEDS. And then I started my next organization and my next organization.

> And so you can't expect to go from zero to a billion in one step. But you can go from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, and then thirty steps later be at a billion. So I think the most important thing is to begin, and call your first shot, have your friends watch you pull it off, something that you can achieve, and then build on top of that a step at a time, and, you know, a few doublings later, you'll be amazed where you end up.

Even the Steve Jobs and Elon Musks of the world started by doing something small. And anyone can do something small.

What small thing are you going to do today?
