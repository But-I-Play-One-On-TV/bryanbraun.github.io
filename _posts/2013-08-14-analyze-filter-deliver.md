  Analyze, filter, deliver. That's probably your job.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Journalists collect tons of information, find the story in all that data, and print what the reader is most interested in. Teachers take their entire working knowledge, isolate the parts that the students need to learn next, and present it in a clear and digestible manner. Computer programmers gather the knowledge and tools to create anything for anyone software-wise, filter out the parts they don't need for a given project, and deliver just what the customer wants. Salesman, storytellers, pastors, researchers, authors, attorneys and engineers. All of them are paid to analyze, filter, and deliver.

  In school they really focus on the "analyze" part. No doubt it's important. But all the analysis in the world won't help you if you cannot filter or deliver. And that's something you have to pick up on your own.
