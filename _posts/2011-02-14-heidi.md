With it being Valentines day today, I believe it is appropriate to introduce the newest face that my wife and I have welcomed into our home. We are very lucky to have her... it's no surprise that she first came on 2/11/2011 at 11:00pm. She is a little lady that goes by the name of Heidi Adele Braun, and we love her very much.

And most of all we are happy to have you as our friends and companions. We wish you a happy Valentines day, and hope that it will be filled with love, just as ours has been on this very special year. Love, Bryan, Holly and Heidi Braun
