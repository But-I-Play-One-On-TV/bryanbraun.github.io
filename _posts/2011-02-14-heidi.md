With it being Valentines day today, I believe it is appropriate to introduce the newest face that my wife and I have welcomed into our home. We are very lucky to have her... it's no surprise that she first came on 2/11/2011 at 11:00pm. She is a little lady that goes by the name of Heidi Adele Braun, and we love her very much.

She was a bit upset when we first met, and to be honest, she looked a little frazzled. And she had such a sour face...

...but eventually she warmed up to us, and we warmed up to her. Now we are all great friends.

We were very excited for her to join our family but most of the time she just seems bored.

What's more? She loves to sleep. She sleeps all day, except for when she eats. And when she isn't eating, she's sleeping.

But our lives are far from boring. We have friends and family who love to visit us and keep us company. The neighbors are so helpful... bringing us gifts and offering to make meals for us. And with me taking courses from home and Holly preparing to return to the elementary school, we are keeping very busy. All these blessings help us feel very happy. In fact, occasionally, we can even get Heidi to crack a smile.

And most of all we are happy to have you as our friends and companions. We wish you a happy Valentines day, and hope that it will be filled with love, just as ours has been on this very special year. Love, Bryan, Holly and Heidi Braun
