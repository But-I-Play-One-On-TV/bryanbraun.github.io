  That's how you make an impact.

<p class="p1">
  Thinking long term is what allows Google to invest in crazy projects over a period of years and then announce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car">self-driving cars</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5994132/heres-how-google-glass-actually-works">glasses that project the internet direcly onto your retina</a> (<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/inside-story-of-moto-x/"><span class="s1">this article about the MotoX</span></a> makes me excited to see what they do with smartphones over the next 10 years).

  It doesn't matter that you don't have Google's budget. Small efforts make a big difference over time. Dripping water hollows out stone, not through force but through persistence. Not everybody has a position of power or influence, but anybody can be persistent.

  Life is long, and time is on your side, if you're thinking long term.
