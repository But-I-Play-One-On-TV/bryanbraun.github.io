If you have a Ruby application and you're trying to figure out how to connect to the Github API using [Octokit][1], you may find it difficult to uncover examples on how to do it. I know it I did.

I ended up asking [Wynn Netherland][2], who [wrote the library][3], and he helped me flesh out a Gist, demonstrating an example of how to connect and pull in all sorts of data from the API, using Sinatra. I've embedded it below for your viewing pleasure.
