We typically find stories on the web in the form of blog posts, video, or a series of comments. That's fine, but where the web really shines is in interactive, mixed-media storytelling. Here are some examples I've seen recently:

*   [Snowfall][1]
*   [What's behind the number][2]
*   [The Jockey][3]
*   [What goes in and out of Hydraulic Fracturing][4]
*   [America: Elect! The action-packed journey to US election day in graphic novel form][5]

People are advertising, teaching, breaking stories, and advancing their agendas in new ways, unique to the web, right before our eyes. Exciting times.
