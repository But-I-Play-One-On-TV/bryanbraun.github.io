I heard these words at an event last Saturday, but I didn't raise my hand. I had all sorts of excuses. I wasn't prepared. It was an unfamiliar situation. I was recovering from sickness. I hadn't slept much the night before. The list goes on.

Now, instead of excuses, I have regrets. I regret missing an opportunity to be generous. I regret that I couldn't push past that hint of fear that was holding me and everybody else back.

So now, before I even get in to the next volunteer situation, I'm deciding that I'll raise my hand. That way the decision's already made before the excuses arrive. Sounds good in theory, but we'll see how it goes.
