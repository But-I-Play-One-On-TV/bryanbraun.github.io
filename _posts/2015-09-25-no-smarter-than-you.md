I heard [this Steve Jobs quote][1] referenced on a recent podcast and had to go back and replay it a couple times because I found it so interesting:

> "When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world... Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.”
Too often I catch myself having a mentality of playing the cards that I've been dealt.

You can deal cards too.
