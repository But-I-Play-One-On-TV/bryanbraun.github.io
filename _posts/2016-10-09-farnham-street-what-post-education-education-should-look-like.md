I just wanted to share something quickly that I've been enjoying immensely.

For the last year or so, I've subscribed to a newsletter/RSS feed for a blog called [Farnham Street][1], which I found via a recommendation.

It's fantastic. I'm a huge proponent of [self-directed][2], [continual][3], [informal][4] education, and Farnham Street is what post-education education should look like. Farnham Street is to me, what Sesame Street is to my preschool-aged kids.

Its main premise can be summarized like this:

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The best way to set yourself up for good future outcomes is knowing how to make better decisions.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The best way to make better decisions is to understand the world as it really is.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The best way to understand the world as it really is, is to build <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/">correct mental models</a> that help you see the forces that shape everything.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The best way to <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-models-world-do-work-for-you/">build mental models</a> is to learn from wise people and read <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/09/books-recommend-someone-read-improve-general-knowledge-world">wise books</a>.
</p>

Wisdom is a long-term pursuit that requires regular thoughtful investments and produces tangible benefits. Ignore [the news wasteland][5] and the election dumpster fire. It's all empty calories. There's more nutritional food-for-thought out there.
