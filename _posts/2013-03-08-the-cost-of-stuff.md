It isn't just the dollars and cents on the price tag. Yes, that's the upfront cost, but if you base your purchases on that alone, you may be in for a sour deal.

<p class="p1">
  Have you considered:
</p>

<li class="p1">
  The cost on the environment
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The cost on your health, or potential health risk
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The cost of your effort every time you need to move it
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The cost of it forcing you to exert mental energy
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The cost of future time that you will spend using it
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of it taking up space in your house
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of maintenance
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of cleaning
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of keeping it organized
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of it distracting you
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The ongoing cost of it worrying you
</li>
<li class="p1">
  The tolls of all these costs on your friends, family, and neighbors
</li>

<p class="p1">
  When I think of the total cost, it's hard for me to find much that is worth buying.
