<p class="p1">
  Having an contrary opinion makes me feel smart and important.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I haven't tried to see the situation from another person's perspective.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  I speak before I think.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I'm not deliberate about identifying and celebrating the positivesÂ 
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I can't muster the emotional strength to fight the tendency
</p>

<p class="p1">
  I feel helpless about my situation and I don't know what else to do about it.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  It's the path of least resistance.
