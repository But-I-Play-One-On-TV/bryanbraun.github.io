  At least according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law"><span class="s1">Sturgeon's Law</span></a>. So you can take this a couple ways.

<li class="p1">
  If your work isn't crap, then congratulations! You're way ahead of the game.
</li>
<li class="p1">
  If you're working your butt off, and your work is still crap, then <a href="http://www.bryanbraun.com/2012/03/19/never-settle-being-mediocre"><span class="s1">don't settle</span></a>, but don't worry. Sometimes you have to plow through the crap to incrementally improve until your work is really good.
</li>

  At least, that's what I keep telling myself.
